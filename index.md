# Let us audit your software and identify <ins>technical debt</ins>

You are planning to invest in a new startup?
You got an on-going project?
No matter how much you trust the team and how motivated it is,
you might regularly [want](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/18/independent-technical-reviews.html)
to review what they are doing,
in order to prevent problems earlier.

<hr/>

{:.wide}
# Do it on a regular basis

{:.wide}
Hire [our experts](https://www.0crat.com/team) to provide you
an <ins>independent opinion</ins> about what your team is doing.
Our reviewers will tell you what kind of technical issues
your software product has and what are the <ins>risks</ins> and <ins>threats</ins>
you should pay attention to.

# Don't wait until programmers <ins>mess</ins> everything up

Hire our [high-caliber software engineers](https://www.0crat.com/team)
for a few hours to get your repositories audited.
This will protect your project from possible disasters.

<hr/>

{:.wide}
# We work with most tech stacks

{:.wide}
[Our experts](https://www.0crat.com/team)
understand Java, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Python and C#.
If you have something else, we can find the right talents
to review your project too.

# We work <ins>remotely</ins> and never talk to your team

There is no need for us to communicate with your
programmers, ask any questions, or disturb them anyhow.
You give us read-only access to your repository, your
logs, your database, and we review what we see, remotely.

<hr/>

{:.wide}
# We sign the NDA before we start

{:.wide}
Each reviewer will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement with you,
confirming that all data received during the review
will be destroyed when the audit is done.

# It takes five days and costs <ins>$2,560</ins>

There are [three types](http://www.zerocracy.com/audits.html) of audits:
quick, standard, and detailed. Most probably your project
needs a standard one, which will give you enough food for though
and will help your team improve. You pay by PayPal, VISA/MasterCard,
or Bitcoins.
