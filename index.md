## We work <ins>remotely</ins> and never talk to your team

There is no need for us to communicate with your
programmers, ask any questions, or disturb them anyhow.
You give us read-only access to your repository, your
logs, your database, and we review what we see, remotely.

## We work with most tech stacks

Our experts understand Java, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Python and C#.
If you have something else, we can find the right talents
to review your project too.
